# Crumbs

Crumbs is a small JavaScript library which allows you to declare what types of cookies your site/application
uses and provides a list of the accepted categories.

## Installation and developing locally

1. Clone the repo via `git clone git@github.com:krystal/crumbs.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to start the deveopment server.
4. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Build

`npm run build` will create the minified bundle in the `dist` folder

## Usage

Crumbs returns a stringed array of the type cookies that are to be set which are defined by passing in objects to the `types` array.

These are accessed by calling the `onSave` method after instantiation.

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {

  const cookies = new Crumbs({
    // options here
  });

  cookies.on('onSave', (preferences) => {
    // Do something with the preferences
  });

});
```

## Options

There are a number of options that are required for the Crumbs constructor.

| Option           | Description                                                                                                              | Type        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| cookieName       | The name you would like the give the cookie                                                                              | string      |
| days             | The duration of the cookie that is set on acceptance                                                                     | number      |

A `type` itself is made up of the following items

| Option     | Description                                                                                                | Type    | Example                                                       |

| title      | A capitalised version of the `identifier` that is used as the heading as part of the edit dialog           | string  | 'Functional'                                                  |

### Example

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {

  const editButton = document.querySelector('.edit-cookies');

  const cookies = new Crumbs({
    cookieName: 'cookie_name',
    domain: 'domain.com',
    editCookieButtons: editButton,
    days: 365,
    types: [
      {
        identifier: 'functional',
        required: true,
        summary:
          'These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.',
        title: 'Functional',
      },

      // More types here

    ]
  });

});
```

### Styling

Most of the styling is left to the project you are using Crumbs in expect a the main positioning of elements. For example, the banner being stuck to the bottom of the page and the edit preferences dialog being in the middle of the screen.

There are however some colours that you can override with some CSS custom properties. These are as follows:

```
:root {
  --crumbs-edit--bg: #f4f4f4;
  --crumbs-edit-overlay: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  --crumbs-edit-cta-bg: gainsboro;
  --crumbs-toggle-switch-bg: #858585;
  --crumbs-toggle-checked-bg: #e0e0e0;
  --crumbs-toggle-border-color: #dddddd;
  --crumbs-toggle-switch-focus-border-color: #a8a8a8;
}
```

What you see above is all the defaults that are provided by Crumbs.
